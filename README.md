## 🛠 Projects

### Sustainable City Design 

**OVERVIEW:**  

Rapid urbanization poses significant challenges to environmental sustainability, equitable growth, and efficient urban systems. Key issues include the need for sustainable city design that prioritizes green infrastructure and renewable energy, smart city integration for efficient resource management, and environmentally conscious urban planning. Additionally, slum development and growth highlight the urgent need for inclusive strategies to improve living conditions and prevent informal settlements. A holistic approach is essential to create resilient, sustainable, and inclusive cities for future generations.

**Technical Stack:** 

- Languages: C++
- Algorithms: Linear Search,Bubble sort,Merge sort,Quick sort,Heap sort,Hashing,KMP and file handling
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

**Impact:**  

### Impact of the Project
